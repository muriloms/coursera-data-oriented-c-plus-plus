## ðŸ“˜ About the Course

This course teaches how to write **efficient and maintainable C++ code** for **data-intensive applications**, focusing on:

- **Scientific simulation software**  
- **Statistical data processing**  
- **Computer graphics**  

### Key Topics
- Modern C++ features for high-efficiency programming.  
- Memory structure and its central role in performance.  
- Limitations of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and the benefits of the **data-oriented programming (DOP)** paradigm.  
- Parallel programming in **C++17 and later**, targeting **multi-core CPUs** and **GPUs**.
